# Fusion Developer Assignment

The `brief` directory contains two images of a designed layout for Mythical Y Corporation.

- `landing-desktop.png`
- `landing-desktop-megamenu.png`

## Requirements

The goal is to create a single responsive web page from the two designs, this template will formulate as a
base tempalte for many other pages in the web site.

As the frontend developer, it is up to you how you acheive this, with the following caveats:

- use any framework you want, but any supporting plugins/mods/libraries must be created by
yourself (ie, jquery but no jquery plugins... angular but no angular libraries)
- The mega menu must use the same `html` in mobile, table and desktop. No duplication of elements.
